### Custom render of Finnish topo maps

Finnish topo maps are really great, but I do not like the way how
they are generalized to small scales. For long distance running/hiking
I prefere a relatively small scale map (say, 1:50000), it's good for planning
and for printing paper map.

The problem is that many important objects are missing at small scales:
all hiking trails and small roads, autiatupa's, etc. I believe, that
using original vector data I can be able to produce a nice-looking
map (probably in a half-manual way, for some regions which are interesting
for me).

I'm using my mapsoft2 system, as in my mountain map project
( https://github.com/slazav/map_hr )

As a first step I downloaded 1:100'000 map data, understood
its structure and rendered images. The next step is to find
and add missing data.
